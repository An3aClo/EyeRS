/**
 * <div>
 * <h3>Aim</h3>
 * <p>
 * The proposed eyeRS mobile application (eyeRS app) is designed to allow users to catalogu their
 * personal effects and beloved belongings while creating a platform to facilitate the trade of their
 * items in the future.
 * </p>
 * </div>
 * <div>
 * <h3>Purpose</h3>
 * <p>
 * The eyeRS app is a Management Information System (MIS). A MIS is systems that use data to
 * generate a report for the enduser to make routine decisions in response to a daily problem. In
 * the case of the eyeRS app a summarised report is created for each item that the user can add to
 * the system. The purpose of the eyeRS app is to give individuals the power to manage and organise
 * their personal and professional lives with less workforce. The eyeRS app achieves this control by
 * allowing users to freely access and catalogue all of their belongings and items that are uploaded
 * to the app. Upload can be don anywhere, on both an android mobile device. Each belonging is saved
 * by means of photo identification and a short description. The app allows users to be connected
 * with friends and family. The connection is achieved by allowing users to share and trade items on
 * their catalogues. The app also allows a user to be connected with their personal belongings anywhere.
 * </p>
 * </div>
 * <div>
 * <h3>Scope</h3>
 * <p>
 * The eyeRS mobile application consists of an inventory for household items. A user is able to
 * upload these items onto the application via the built in camera or a local file source such as the
 * gallery. A bid or buy system is implemented for users who wish to sell any unwanted items. All
 * items that are is put up for sale is available to all users that have downloaded the mobile
 * application. Contact information is made available interested parties. Personal inventories can
 * be shared with other users via social media WhatsApp or by means of Bluetooth connections.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Included in system requirements is information users need to know about their software and hardware
 * components in order to run the eyeRS app successfully. The eyeRS app will be a conventional app
 * when it comes to requirements, in which users will need to have any device that runs an Android OS.
 * There are many apps on the market each one with its identifiers, look and functionality. eyeRS will
 * help users organise their belongings (virtually) into categories, or to sell or trade and share
 * items by using a single app.
