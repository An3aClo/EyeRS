## Aim
The proposed eyeRS mobile application (app) is designed to allow users to catalog their personal effects and beloved belongings while creating a platform to facilitate the trade of their items in the future.

## Purpose
The eyeRS app is a Management Information System (MIS). A MIS is system that uses data to generate a report for the end-user to make routine decisions in response to a daily problem (Cress, 2017). In the case of the eyeRS app, a summarised report is created for each item that the user can add to the system. The purpose of the eyeRS app is to give individuals the power to manage and organise their personal and professional lives with less workforce. The eyeRS app achieves this control by allowing users to freely access and catalog all of their belongings and items that are uploaded to the app. Uploads can be done anywhere. Each belonging is saved by means of photo identification and a short description. The app allows users to be connected with friends and family. The connection is achieved by allowing users to share and trade items on their catalogs. The app also allows a user to be connected with their personal belongings anywhere.

## Scope
The eyeRS mobile application consists of an inventory for household items. A user is able to upload these items onto the application via the built in camera or a local file source such as the gallery. The concept of a 'bid or buy' system is implemented for users who wish to sell any unwanted items. All items that are put up for sale are available to all users that have downloaded the mobile application. Contact information is made available for interested parties. Personal inventories can be shared with other users via social media WhatsApp or by means of Bluetooth connections.

Included in the system requirements is information users need to know about their software and hardware components in order to run the eyeRS app successfully. The eyeRS app will be a conventional app when it comes to requirements, in which users will need to have any device that runs an Android OS of IceCreamSandwich/better. There are many apps on the market, each one with its identifiers, look and functionality. eyeRS will help users organise their belongings (virtually) into categories, or to sell or trade and share items by using a single app.
